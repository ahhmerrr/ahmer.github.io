## My personal website!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110292814/185671659-c41a0793-0249-41f4-9c78-6cbffb47dcac.png)

Made minimalistically, using no dependencies except for JQuery.

The code segment at the beginning is JavaScript, stylized to look like it's in VSCode using the [Monokai Pro](https://monokai.pro/) theme.

The typed text effect was inspired by myself making typing mistakes all the time :)

The terminal ("ChiliShell") was inspired by [JQuery Terminal](https://terminal.jcubic.pl/). It is not really a shell, of course.

The [chili icon](https://www.flaticon.com/premium-icon/chili_2156631?term=pepper&page=1&position=1&page=1&position=1&related_id=2156631&origin=tag) is from Flaticon, and the [arrow icon](https://www.pngrepo.com/svg/65054/up-arrow) is from PNGRepo.

Finally, the [GitHub icon](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png) is from GitHub itself.

```javascript
const sendOff = () => {
    console.log(
        "%c Thanks for checking out my website source! 🥳",
        "color: crimson; font-weight: bold;"
    );
};
```
