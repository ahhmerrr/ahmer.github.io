Made minimalistically, using no dependencies except for JQuery.

The terminal ("ChiliShell") was inspired by [JQuery Terminal](https://terminal.jcubic.pl/). It is not really a shell, of course.

The typed text effect was inspired by myself making typing mistakes all the time :)

The [chili icon](https://www.flaticon.com/premium-icon/chili_2156631?term=pepper&page=1&position=1&page=1&position=1&related_id=2156631&origin=tag) is from Flaticon, and the [arrow icon](https://www.pngrepo.com/svg/65054/up-arrow) is from PNGRepo.
