made minimalistically, with no dependencies except for JQuery.

the code segment at the beginning is JavaScript, stylized to look like VSCode using the [Monokai Pro](https://monokai.pro/) theme.

the typed text effect was inspired by myself making typing mistakes all the time.

the terminal ("ChiliShell") was inspired by [JQuery Terminal](https://terminal.jcubic.pl/). it isn't really a shell, of course.

the [chili icon](https://www.flaticon.com/premium-icon/chili_2156631?term=pepper&page=1&position=1&page=1&position=1&related_id=2156631&origin=tag) is from Flaticon, and the [arrow icon](https://www.pngrepo.com/svg/65054/up-arrow) is from PNGRepo.

finally, the [GitHub icon](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png) is from GitHub itself.

```javascript
const sendOff = () => {
    console.log(
        "%c thanks for checking out my website source! 🥳",
        "color: crimson; font-weight: bold;"
    );
};
```
